You know what's funny? Got completely lost trying to find this hiking trail and ended up in this tiny town called Yugawara. Found this little sushi place - just six seats, run by this older couple. Not normally one to get excited about food, but wow... their otoro was something else. Fun things can happen if you're open to them.
